# AerosolPython

The AerosolPython package provides the **aeropy** python framework for conducting Aerosol Physics and Chemistry computations.

## Description

aeropy provides functionality for calculating aerosol related basic functions:
typical unit conversion, math operations and time operations (as aerosol data often deal with time series)

aeropy also includes classes for calculations of more complex aerosol mechanics and kinetics.

### Submodules

1. aeropy includes the submodule `aeropy.instruments` which provides functionality related to typical aerosol measurement devices.
   currently supports differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) or condensation particle counters (CPCs). 


## Installation

AerosolPython is intended to be a python package indexed in PyPi and installation will be made possible via pip. 
As soon as this is available it can be installed via:
`pip install aerosolpython`

Currently this is not impelmented yet and the package needs to be installed from source. A setup.py file is included in the package. 
Please find the source code available in the public [GitLab repository of Aerosolpython](https://gitlab.tuwien.ac.at/dominik.stolzenburg/aerosolpython) hosted by TU Wien. 

There are two options for installation. 

1. Download .tar.gz file from GitLab.
   Go to the path of your current python environment. In conda use:
   `conda info --envs`
   to see where your environment is installed. In that path find the absolute path to python.exe, for example:
   `"C:\Program Files\Anaconda3\python.exe"`
   Now, run the following command:
   `<absolute path to python.exe> -m pip install <path to tar.gz>`
   Note that <path to tar.gz> can be relative, absolute and even an online link.

2. Clone the repository from GitLab using e.g., ssh. 
   Go to the path of the clondes repository and run:
   `python setup.py install`
   command or its usual variants (`python setup.py install --user`,
   `python setup.py install --prefix=/PATH/TO/INSTALL/DIRECTORY`, etc.)

## Prerequisits

Python 3 needs to be used.

Current prerequisits:

`numpy>=1.21`
`scipy>=1.7.3`
`pandas>=1.4.2`

## Usage

aeropy can be currently used for:
1. aerosol mechanics calculations e.g., mean free path of aerosols and vapors, slip correction, diffusion coefficients, diffusional losses.
2. aerosol kinetics calculations such as collision kernels
3. aerosol utilities such as unit conversions, math operations (e.g., integration of size distributions)

Once installed as outlined above you can simply import `aerosolpython` using its import name `aeropy` with the recommended abbreviation:

`import aeropy as ap`

## Support

The package is maintained by Dominik Stolzenburg. All requests should be directed to dominik.stolzenburg@tuwien.ac.at

## Roadmap

1) Full implementation of above described functionalization. 
2) Fist release and packaging
3) Future updates on the following submodules: instruments, growth, dynamics. 
4) Publish a software paper describing the package.

## Project status

Almost all code already exists, but the repo needs to be properly build, and documentations needs to be completed. 
Release 0.1.0 is being prepared currently.
