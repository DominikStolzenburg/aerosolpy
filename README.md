# AerosolPython

The AerosolPython package provides the aeropy python framework for conducting Aerosol Physics and Chemistry computations.

## Description

aeropy provides functionality for calculating aerosol related basic functions:
typical unit conversion, math operations and time operations (as aerosol data often deal with time series)

aeropy also includes classes for calculations of more complex aerosol mechanics and kinetics.

aeropy also contains the submodule instruments which provides classes corresponding to typical aerosol instruments
aeropy also contains the submodule growth which can be used to calculate nanoparticle growth rates from vapor concentrations.

## Installation

AerosolPython is intended to be a python package indexed in PyPi and installation will be made possible via pip. 
Currently this is not impelmented yet and the package needs to be installed from source.  

## Usage

Will be added later.

## Support

The package is maintained by Dominik Stolzenburg. All requests should be directed to dominik.stolzenburg@tuwien.ac.at

## Roadmap

1) Full implementation of above described functionalization. 
2) Fist release and packaging
3) Future updates on the growth submodule.
